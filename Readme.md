# One hour wallet

A repo with code from a presentation at the Bitcoin Designathon session on Oct 14, 2022.
We built a bitcoin wallet in one hour that can receive and send bitcoin on testnet.

Uses:

- BDK Manager
- Bitcoin UI Kit

Caveats:

- It does not save the wallet, so each restart will generate a new one
- It's rough around the edges
